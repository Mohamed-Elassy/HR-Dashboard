# 👥 HR Analytics & Workforce Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📖 The Story
In this project, I developed a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard to support strategic workforce decision-making.  
The dashboard provides HR managers and leadership with a complete view of employee demographics, satisfaction, promotion readiness, and retention trends. By visualizing these metrics across two interactive pages, the organization can proactively manage talent, reduce attrition risks, and plan career development initiatives.
